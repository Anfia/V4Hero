Items are stored in two folders, alignment and textures.
Aligment folder stores data on how the item should be placed when Patapon is holding it.
Textures folder stores the textures that are displayed in game.

Each folder has a subfolder, which is a group of items. Groups are done to differentiate IDs from main, canon game and from future mods.
Main Patafour item group is "main". Do not change it, if you want to create a new item group, create a folder with your custom name.

Game will automatically load all groups from this folder, unless there's a "mods" folder created in the root directory of the game.
