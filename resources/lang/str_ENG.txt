newgame_intro_1|After finishing the Patapole Bridge, we\finally arrived in new lands, untouched\by the hands of the Almighty Patapon.
newgame_intro_10|As it began to approach us, we luckily saved ourselves\with the ancient machine we had used once before,\barely escaping the despairing jaws of death.
newgame_intro_11|...
newgame_intro_12|Almighty, I pray to you!\Please guide us to Earthend.
newgame_intro_13|Save our world from evil\and let us finally gaze upon IT!
newgame_intro_14|Please, take the holy drum\and let us march once more!
newgame_intro_2|In this unfamiliar place, we discovered\the ruins of an ancient civilization,\seemingly long forgotten.
newgame_intro_3|Desperate to find IT, we began tinkering\with the ancient mechanisms that\were found buried within the rubble.
newgame_intro_4|With a single button press, our three Yaripons,\Hero, and myself, were sent to an bizarre\and unfamiliar location filled with nature\and wildlife, seemingly devoid of any civilization.
newgame_intro_5|Worried about our comrades, we attempted\everything we could to return back home,\and thank the Almighty Patapon that we succeeded!
newgame_intro_6|However...
newgame_intro_7|Upon our return, we came back to discover\the bodies of our allies. Judging by\their wounds, their deaths were recent.
newgame_intro_8|The sky above was dyed bloody red,\and the screams of the very few survivors\could be heard in the distance.
newgame_intro_9|We looked up to the skies and were met with\a terrifying yet mysterious figure floating\ominously above us. It's singular eye was\filled with resentment and hatred.
npc_sen_1|Oh Great Kami!\Lead us to Earthend.
npc_sen_10|The Kirajins built another\fortress at Ejiji Cliffs.
npc_sen_11|We can't let them win...!\Go and defeat them, Kami!
npc_sen_12|You did it God! You did it!\It's over for now...
npc_sen_13|I still can't remember where\I've seen them before...
npc_sen_2|Oh Mighty Kami!\Lead us to Earthend.
npc_sen_3|Oh Mighty Patapon!\Lead us to Earthend.
npc_sen_4|There are many animals\wandering on Shida Valley.
npc_sen_5|Rumors say countless treasures\were buried in it's grounds.
npc_sen_6|Something attacked the Patapon\woodcutters at Patapine Grove!
npc_sen_7|Yaripon scouts report red,\triangular creatures building\a fortress from stolen wood...
npc_sen_8|"Kirajins"...? Is this\how they were called? 
npc_sen_9|I think I heard this\name before...
npc_wakapon_1|I am Wakapon! Guard of\the World Egg for Kami's order!
npc_wakapon_10|Fantastic job, Kami! You destroyed\their fortress at Ejiji Cliffs.
npc_wakapon_11|However, evil never rests.\Kirajins gather energy from\strange red crystals. Destroy\them to weaken their army!
npc_wakapon_2|Welcome, Kami! I am very grateful\to speak with you in person!
npc_wakapon_3|You can be confident in me,\I'll protect the World Egg\with my life, promise!
npc_wakapon_4|I can feel something evil\coming to our world...
npc_wakapon_5|Do you feel it too, Kami?\Will you protect us from\any danger we may face?
npc_wakapon_6|These triangular creatures...\What are they? What do they\want from us Patapons?
npc_wakapon_7|Their eyes are filled with hatred...\I'm afraid it's only the beginning.
npc_wakapon_8|A perilous quest awaits\you and your troops, Kami.
npc_wakapon_9|Kirajins are in possession of\technology that is not of this\world. You must remain strong.

worldmap_location_3_description|Ejiji Cliffs once saw the age of mighty dragons before they disappeared from their place of birth for reasons unknown to Rolitoland's inhabitants, and provides a good spot for building homes and fortresses hidden from plain sight alike.
